# AdTechSampleWork

An analysis of the video ads data gathered from a dataset in Kaggle. The main goal of the project was to highlight my data analysis abilities, specifically with a slant towards the adtech space. The repository contains a jupyter notebook of my work, a pdf containing my looker report which contains visualizations to compliment my findings and a filtered .csv file I used to feed into Looker. However, the originally csv from Kaggle was quite large, almost 500mb. Due to the the limitations of size files on Github, I have not included the original data in the repository, but I have included a link to the original Kaggle dataset here in the README. Finaly, in the jupyter notebook, I have also explicitly imported the Kagglehub package which allows the user to download from Kaggle at the moment of execution instead of loading the .csv file from a local machine.
